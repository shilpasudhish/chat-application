## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git`

`cd chat-app`

### 2. Use Node.js Version 18

Ensure you have Node.js v18 installed. If you use nvm, switch to Node 18 with:

`nvm use 18`

If you don't have nvm, install Node.js v18 from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install necessary dependencies by running:

`npm install`

### 4. Install Expo CLI

If you don't already have the Expo CLI globally, install it using:

`npm install -g expo-cli`

### 5. Configure Firebase

1. Go to the Firebase console.
2. Create a new Firebase project.
3. Enable Firestore and Firebase Storage:
   - In Firestore and Storage, set the rules as follows during development:

'{ "rules": { ".read": "auth != null", ".write": "auth != null" } }'


4. Add a web app to your project and copy the config.
5. Add the Firebase config to your project in the `firebaseConfig` object in `App.js`:

'const firebaseConfig = { apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN", projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET", messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID", appId: "YOUR_APP_ID" };'


### 6. Run the App Locally

Start the development server using:

`npm run start`

After starting:

- Open the app on your physical device using the Expo Go app.
- Or run it on an Emulator (Android Studio).
